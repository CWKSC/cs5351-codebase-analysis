# How it can show all user's github project
After implementing PKCE and successfully authenticating a user with their GitHub account, we can fetch and display their GitHub projects. Here's how it works conceptually:
Authentication:
• The user authorizes your app through GitHub's OAuth flow with PKCE.
• Your app receives an access token.
Using the Access Token:
• The access token acts as a key to make authenticated requests to GitHub's API on behalf of the user.
Fetching Projects:
• GitHub provides an API endpoint to list a user's repositories.
• You would make a GET request to this endpoint using the access token.
API Request:
• The request would typically go to: https://api.github.com/user/repos
• You'd include the access token in the Authorization header.
Response Handling:
• GitHub's API will return a JSON array containing information about each repository.
• This includes details like repository name, description, URL, etc.
Display:
• You would then process this data in your React component.
• You could map over the array of repositories and display them in your UI.
Pagination:
• If the user has many repositories, you might need to handle pagination.
• GitHub's API provides information for navigating through pages of results.
Caching (Optional):
• To improve performance, you might cache this data client-side.
• You could refresh it periodically or when the user requests an update.
Error Handling:
• You'd need to handle potential errors, like expired tokens or API rate limits.
